# Load Raw Data Processing Rules

This document describes the rules for running the `load_raw.py` script to test processing

## Prerequisites

- Conda environment named 'alpha' must be available
- Maturin must be installed for building Rust extensions
- Required Python packages must be installed in the conda environment

## Execution Steps

1. Activate the conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate alpha
   ```

2. Build the Rust extension:
   ```bash
   maturin develop
   ```

3. Run the Python script with the HDF file:
   ```bash
   python scripts/load_raw.py '/Users/georgwallmann/Documents/data/alphadia_tutorials/libfree-gui/raw_data/20231024_OA3_TiHe_ADIAMA_HeLa_200ng_Evo01_21min_F-40_iO_before_03.hdf'
   ```

## Output

The script will process the HDF file and generate an XIC index histogram. Progress will be logged to the console.
